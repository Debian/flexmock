Short term things to do:

* Consolidate the :on option with mocks
* Pass through mode for partial mocks
* Update readme

DONE

* Consolidate mock block detection and spy block detection.

IDEAS

spy.should have_received(:foo).with(arg1, arg2)
spy.should have_received.foo(arg1, arg2)


assert_called spy, :foo, arg1, arg2
assert_spy(spy).received(:foo).with(arg1, arg2)
